Hey y'all, I'm Carmen!

I'm a singer, wife, mom, and developer. I live in Austin, TX (hook 'em!) and am a true techie at heart. I love creating music, and I love coding. Take a look at some of my creations!


## Project Notes

* Leveraging the Bootstrap CSS Framework, I've created a mobile responsive portfolio site, with the following subpages:
    * `index.html` 
    * `portfolio.html` 
    * `resume.html`
    * `contact.html`

* Each page of the website contains the following elements:

   * A navbar with the following links: Home, Portfolio, Resume, Contact
   * A responsive layout
   * Responsive images
   * A sticky footer
